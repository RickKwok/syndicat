An ubber fast RSS parser and reader

## Feature Ideas
A few features that *may* be implemented in the future:

* full article fetching
* embedded [spritzing](http://spritzinc.com/) for fast, easy article reading. 
  Doesn't work well for articles with tables or images (See also: [Glance](https://github.com/Miserlou/Glance),
