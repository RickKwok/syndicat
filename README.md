# SyndiCat [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jchristi/syndicat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jchristi/syndicat)
An ubber fast RSS parser and reader based on Tiny-Tiny-RSS

## Installation
Currently no working installation.

## Feature Ideas
A few features that *may* be implemented in the future:

* full article fetching
* embedded [spritzing](http://spritzinc.com/) for fast, easy article reading. 
  Doesn't work well for articles with tables or images (See also: [Glance](https://github.com/Miserlou/Glance), 
  [Squirt](https://github.com/cameron/squirt))
* Pluggable feed entry exporters (ie. "send to" / "share")
  
## Contributing
Contributions welcome. Please include mocha tests with all PRs.
